# Fish-Shoal-Simulation-In-CUDA

Project implements simulation of fishshoal (boids).
OpenGL part is taken from Nvidia samples repo (https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples).

Keybindings:
q - increase separation force
a - decrease separation force

w- increase alignment force
s- decrease alignment force

e - increase cohision force
d - decrease cohision force

r - increase inertia force
f - decrease inertia force

t - increase interaction radius
g - decrease interaction radius
